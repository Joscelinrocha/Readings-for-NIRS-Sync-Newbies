# Readings for NIRS and fNIRS Synchrony Beginners

Welcome to the **Readings for NIRS and fNIRS Sync Newbies** repository! This collection is designed to help researchers and team members who are new to Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), and their applications in brain activity research. The readings focus on both individual and dyadic brain activity, offering a foundational understanding of key concepts and methodologies.

## About This Repository

This repository contains a curated selection of PDF readings that serve as an introduction to NIRS and fNIRS, particularly in the context of synchrony and brain activity data processing. Whether you are investigating individual brain responses or exploring inter-brain synchrony in dyads, these readings will provide essential knowledge to help you get started.

## Contents

The readings in this repository cover topics such as:

- Fundamentals of NIRS and fNIRS technology
- Data collection and preprocessing methods
- Brain activity analysis in individuals and dyads
- Applications of synchrony in NIRS/fNIRS research
